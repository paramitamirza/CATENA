OTC Focus: @ Sell Programs @ Are Hurting @ Market Makers @ ---- @ By Sonja Steptoe and Craig Smith @ Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal 10/30/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) STOCK INDEXES (NDX) SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) NEW YORK

<TEXT>
Market makers in Nasdaq over-the-counter stocks are <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e1">adding</EVENT> their voices to the swelling chorus of complaints about program trading.

Their motivation, however, has a strong practical aspect: Program trading is hazardous to their paychecks. The most controversial form of program trading, stock-index arbitrage, is " <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e298">making</EVENT> it tough for traders to make money," <EVENT class="REPORTING" eid="e297">declares</EVENT> Robert Antolini, head of OTC trading at Donaldson, Lufkin amp Jenrette.

Stock-index <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e17">arbitrage</EVENT> -- the computer-guided buying and selling of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to profit from fleeting price discrepancies -- <EVENT class="I_STATE" eid="e25">affects</EVENT> the OTC market directly through the 31 stocks included in Standard amp Poor's 500-stock index. The SampP 500 is often used in arbitrage strategies.

The portion of OTC volume attributable to program trading isn't known, as it is on the New York Stock Exchange, where it <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e34">amounted</EVENT> to more than 13% in <TIMEX3 anchorTimeID="t0" functionInDocument="NONE" temporalFunction="true" tid="t295" type="DATE" value="1989-09">September</TIMEX3>. <EVENT class="I_STATE" eid="e35">Estimates</EVENT> from traders put it at less than 5% of Nasdaq's average daily volume of roughly 133 million shares.

Other market-maker gripes: Program <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e38">trading</EVENT> also <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e39">causes</EVENT> the Nasdaq Composite Index to <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e41">lose</EVENT> ground against other segments of the stock market. Because of program <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e43">trading</EVENT> it is more <EVENT class="I_STATE" eid="e299">difficult</EVENT> to <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e45">trade</EVENT> many OTC stocks without sharp price <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e46">moves</EVENT>, a condition known as illiquidity. Moreover, the price <EVENT class="STATE" eid="e302">volatility</EVENT> that is <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e48">amplified</EVENT> by program <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e49">trading</EVENT> is <EVENT class="I_ACTION" eid="e50">undercutting</EVENT> <EVENT class="I_ACTION" eid="e51">efforts</EVENT> to <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e53">woo</EVENT> individual investors back to an OTC market that sorely <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e55">misses</EVENT> them.

Some of these <EVENT class="STATE" eid="e547">problems</EVENT> are neither new nor unique to the OTC market. But the big, often tumultuous <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e57">slide</EVENT> in stock prices <TIMEX3 anchorTimeID="t0" functionInDocument="NONE" temporalFunction="true" tid="t303" type="DATE" value="1989-10">this month</TIMEX3> has <EVENT class="I_STATE" eid="e58">turned</EVENT> some of those who have been <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e59">profiting</EVENT> from the practice against it.

Peter DaPuzzo, head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton, <EVENT class="REPORTING" eid="e63">acknowledges</EVENT> that he wasn't <EVENT class="STATE" eid="e305">troubled</EVENT> by program <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e64">trading</EVENT> when it <EVENT class="ASPECTUAL" eid="e66">began</EVENT> in the pre-crash bull market because it <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e69">added</EVENT> liquidity and people were <EVENT class="I_STATE" eid="e308">pleased</EVENT> to <EVENT class="PERCEPTION" eid="e71">see</EVENT> stock prices <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e72">rising</EVENT>.

"We weren't as concerned until they <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e75">became</EVENT> sell programs," <EVENT class="REPORTING" eid="e76">says</EVENT> Mr. DaPuzzo, who <TIMEX3 anchorTimeID="t0" functionInDocument="NONE" temporalFunction="true" tid="t311" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> <EVENT class="I_STATE" eid="e77">thinks</EVENT> it <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e78">adds</EVENT> unnecessary volatility. Shearson Lehman, however, executes program trades for clients.

Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Kidder Peabody, in addition to Shearson, do program-trade OTC stocks. Shearson, Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs say they do so only for customers, however. Kidder Peabody does program trading for its own as well as clients' accounts.

Of course, there were sell <EVENT class="STATE" eid="e318">programs</EVENT> in <TIMEX3 anchorTimeID="t0" functionInDocument="NONE" temporalFunction="true" tid="t320" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">past years</TIMEX3>, too, but they <EVENT class="I_STATE" eid="e90">seem</EVENT> to <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e92">hurt</EVENT> market makers more painfully <TIMEX3 anchorTimeID="t0" functionInDocument="NONE" temporalFunction="true" tid="t321" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">these days</TIMEX3>. That's largely because of defensive measures they <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e94">adopted</EVENT> after the <TIMEX3 functionInDocument="NONE" temporalFunction="false" tid="t323" type="DATE" value="1987">1987</TIMEX3> <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e95">crash</EVENT>, when individual investors <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e98">fled</EVENT> the market and trading activity <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e101">dwindled</EVENT>. Market makers, to <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e103">cut</EVENT> costs, <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e104">slashed</EVENT> inventories of stocks they keep on hand to sell investors when other holders aren't selling.

And to <EVENT class="I_ACTION" eid="e114">protect</EVENT> their reduced capital investment from <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e117">eroding</EVENT> further, market makers became quicker to <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e324">lower</EVENT> price quotes when sell programs are <EVENT class="STATE" eid="e1093">in</EVENT> progress. On days when prices are tumbling, they must be <EVENT class="I_STATE" eid="e326">willing</EVENT> to <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e127">buy</EVENT> shares from sellers when no one else will. In such an environment, market makers can <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e130">suffer</EVENT> huge <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e327">losses</EVENT> both on trades made that day at steadily dropping prices and in the value of their inventories of shares.

"It <EVENT class="I_STATE" eid="e329">makes</EVENT> no <EVENT class="I_STATE" eid="e140">sense</EVENT> for us to <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e142">put</EVENT> money at risk when you <EVENT class="I_STATE" eid="e147">know</EVENT> you're going to lose," <EVENT class="REPORTING" eid="e151">says</EVENT> Mr. Antolini, of Donaldson Lufkin.

But this <EVENT class="STATE" eid="e330">skittishness</EVENT>, Mr. Antolini says, is <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e153">creating</EVENT> liquidity <EVENT class="STATE" eid="e331">problems</EVENT> in certain OTC stocks. "It's harder to sell stocks when the sell programs come in because some market makers don't want to { take the orders}. No one has big positions and no one wants to take big risks."

Joseph Hardiman, president of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which oversees trading on Nasdaq, <EVENT class="I_ACTION" eid="e171">agrees</EVENT> that program trading is <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e173">hurting</EVENT> the market's <EVENT class="I_ACTION" eid="e175">efforts</EVENT> to <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e177">bring</EVENT> back small investors. But, he <EVENT class="REPORTING" eid="e178">observes</EVENT>, while makers <EVENT class="I_STATE" eid="e180">suffer</EVENT> <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e333">losses</EVENT> when program trading <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e184">drags</EVENT> the market down, they also <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e185">make</EVENT> money when program trading <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e190">pushes</EVENT> the prices higher. "Sometimes {traders} <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e191">lose</EVENT> sight of that," he <EVENT class="REPORTING" eid="e193">says</EVENT>.

The OTC stocks in the SampP 500 include Nasdaq's biggest, such as Apple Computer, MCI Communications, Tele-Communications and Liz Claiborne. These big stocks greatly influence the Nasdaq Composite Index. When the computers say "sell," the composite tumbles as well as the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

The problem, market makers say, is that while the industrial average and the SampP 500 usually recover as buy programs kick in, the Nasdaq Composite frequently is left behind.

<TIMEX3 beginPoint="t335" functionInDocument="NONE" mod="EQUAL_OR_MORE" temporalFunction="false" tid="t336" type="DURATION" value="P8D">Eight trading days</TIMEX3> after <TIMEX3 anchorTimeID="t0" functionInDocument="NONE" temporalFunction="true" tid="t335" type="DATE" value="1989-10-12">Oct. 12</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 anchorTimeID="t335" functionInDocument="NONE" temporalFunction="true" tid="t338" type="DATE" value="1989-10-12">the day</TIMEX3> before the stock market <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e205">plunge</EVENT>, for instance, the Nasdaq Composite had <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e208">fallen</EVENT> 4.3%, compared with 3.3% for the SampP 500, 3.5% for the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index and 3.6% for the industrial average. This gap eventually <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e210">closes</EVENT>, but slowly. <TIMEX3 endPoint="t340" functionInDocument="NONE" temporalFunction="false" tid="t341" type="DURATION" value="P3D">Three days</TIMEX3> later, as of <TIMEX3 anchorTimeID="t0" functionInDocument="NONE" temporalFunction="true" tid="t340" type="DATE" value="1989-10-27">Friday</TIMEX3>'s <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e211">close</EVENT>, the Nasdaq Composite was down 6%, compared with 5.9% for the industrial average, 5.7% for the SampP 500 and 5.8% for the Big Board Composite.

The main reason for this <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e214">lag</EVENT> is that individual investors <EVENT class="STATE" eid="e345">own</EVENT> 65% of the OTC market's capitalization, <EVENT class="REPORTING" eid="e346">according</EVENT> to Mr. Hardiman, much more than on the Big Board. Such investors tend to be more cautious than institutional investors are about re-entering the market after massive selloffs, market makers say.

The Nasdaq Composite Index <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e223">tumbled</EVENT> 5.39, or 1.2% to 452.76 on <TIMEX3 anchorTimeID="t0" functionInDocument="NONE" temporalFunction="true" tid="t356" type="DATE" value="1989-10-27">Friday</TIMEX3>.
