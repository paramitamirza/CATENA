The Roman Empire (Latin: Imperium Romanum) was the post-Republican period of the ancient Roman civilisation, characterised by an autocratic form of government, headed by an Emperor, and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia Minor. The 500 year old republic which preceded it had been destabilised through a series of civil wars. Several events marked the transition of power from the Roman Senate to an autocratic Emperor. Julis Caesar's <EVENT eid="e1001">appointment</EVENT> as perpetual dictator in <TIMEX3 tid="t1001">44 BC</TIMEX3> after his <EVENT eid="e1002">victory</EVENT> over Pompey resulted in his <EVENT eid="e1003">assassination</EVENT>, triggering a power vacuum that led to a succession of <EVENT eid="e1004">conflicts</EVENT> between supporters of Caesar and the Senate. Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, defeated Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in <TIMEX3 tid="t1002">31 BC</TIMEX3> after inheriting Caesar's estates. Following Antony and Cleopatra's <EVENT eid="e1005">suicides</EVENT>, the Roman Senate <EVENT eid="e1006">granted</EVENT> the honorific title Augustus to Octavian in 27 BC, effectively bringing about the <EVENT eid="e1007">end</EVENT> of the Roman Republic.

The imperial successor to the Republic endured for some 500 years. Following Octavian's victory, the first two centuries of the Empire's existence were a period of unprecedented political stability and prosperity known as the Pax Romana, or "Roman Peace". Following the assassination of the mad Emperor Caligula in 41 AD, the Praetorian Guard briefly considered returning power to the Roman Senate, however their proclamation of Claudius ensured the Empire's longevity. After Claudius' successor, Nero, died in 68 AD, the Empire suffered a period of brief civil wars, as well as a concurrent major rebellion in Judea, during which four different legionary generals were proclaimed Emperor. Vespasian emerged triumphant in 69 AD, establishing the Flavian dynasty. The rule of the Five Good Emperors in the late 1st and 2nd centuries saw widespread territorial and social expansion. The Empire reached its greatest extent under Trajan, the second in this line, conquering Nabataea, Dacia, Armenia and Mesopotamia.

The reign of Commodus began a period of decline in imperial prosperity. Commodus' assassination in <TIMEX3 tid="t1003">192 AD</TIMEX3> triggered the Year of the Five Emperors, of which Septimus Severus <EVENT eid="e1008">emerged</EVENT> victorious the following year. The assassination of Alexander Severus in 222 AD led to the <EVENT eid="e1009">Crisis</EVENT> of the Third Century in which 26 men were declared Emperor by the Roman Senate over a fifty year period. The Empire split into three competing factions; the Gallic Empire, the Palmyrene Empire and the Roman Empire proper, suffering through foreign invasions and economic depression. Aurelian re-conquered the Gallic and Palmyrene factions, reuniting the Empire proper, earning him the title Restitutor Orbis or "Restorer of the World". However, it was not until the reign of Diocletian that the Empire was successfully stabilised. Under Dicoletian's reign, the empire was divided in half, with the Western half centred on Rome, while the Eastern half was ruled from Byzantium by a co-emperor.

The division was ultimately unsuccessful, leading to a <EVENT eid="e1010">civil war</EVENT> that was finally ended by Constantine I, who defeated his rivals Maxentius and Licinius, <EVENT eid="e1011">becoming</EVENT> sole ruler of east and west. Constantine also adopted Christianity as the official religion of the Empire, ending centuries of Roman polytheism and leading to a massive rise in power of the Christian religion. From Constantine's death in 337, the dominion of the Empire was gradually eroded by abuses of power, civil wars, barbarian migrations and invasions, military reforms and economic depression. The Sack of Rome in 410 by the Visigoths and the subsequent deposition of Romulus Augustus in 476 by Odoacer is generally accepted to mark the end of the Western Roman civilisation. The Eastern Roman Empire, centred in Constantinople endured for another thousand years, eventually falling to the Ottoman Turks under Mehmed II in 1453.

During its tenure, the Roman Empire was the most powerful economic, cultural and military force in Europe. The longevity and vast extent of the Empire ensured the lasting influence of Latin and Greek language, culture, religion, architecture, philosophy, law and governmental forms on the Empire's descendants. Throughout the European medieval period, attempts were even made to establish successors to the Roman Empire, including the Crusader state, the Empire of Romania and the Holy Roman Empire. By means of European expansionism, especially through the Spanish, French and British empires, Roman and Greek culture was spread on a worldwide scale, playing a significant role in the development of the modern world.

History.

Rome had begun annexing provinces in the 3rd century BC, four centuries before reaching its greatest territorial extent, and in that sense was an "empire" while still governed as a republic. Republican provinces were administered by former consuls and praetors, who had been elected to one-year terms and held imperium, "right of command". The amassing of disproportionate wealth and military power by a few men through their provincial commands was a major factor in the transition from republic to imperial autocracy. Later, the position of power held by the emperor was expressed as imperium. The Latin word is the origin of English "empire," a meaning it began to acquire only later in Rome's history.

As the first emperor, Augustus took the official position that he had saved the Republic, and carefully framed his powers within republican constitutional principles. He rejected titles that Romans associated with monarchy, and instead referred to himself as the princeps, "leading citizen". Consuls continued to be elected, tribunes of the people continued to put forth legislation, and senators still debated in the curia. It was Augustus, however, who established the precedent that the emperor controlled the final decisions, backed up by military force.

The reign of Augustus, from 27 BC to 14 AD, was portrayed in Augustan literature and art as a new "Golden Age." Augustus laid out an enduring ideological foundation for the three centuries of the Empire known as the Principate (27 BC - 284 AD), the first 200 years of which is traditionally regarded as the Pax Romana. During this period, the cohesion of the Empire was <EVENT eid="e1012">furthered</EVENT> by participation in civic life, economic ties, and shared cultural, legal and religious norms. Uprisings in the provinces were infrequent, but put down "mercilessly and swiftly" when they occurred, as in Britain and Gaul. The sixty years of Jewish - Roman wars in the second half of the first century and the first half of the 2nd century were exceptional in their duration and violence.

The success of Augustus in establishing principles of dynastic succession was limited by his outliving a number of talented potential heirs: the Julio-Claudian dynasty lasted for four more emperors - Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero - before it yielded in 69 AD to the strife-torn Year of Four Emperors, from which Vespasian emerged as victor.

Vespasian <EVENT eid="e1013">became</EVENT> the founder of the brief Flavian dynasty, to be followed by the Nerva - Antonine dynasty which <EVENT eid="e1014">produced</EVENT> the "Five Good Emperors": Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius and the philosophically inclined Marcus Aurelius. In the view of the Greek historian Dio Cassius, a contemporary observer, the accession of the emperor Commodus in 180 AD marked the descent "from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron" - a famous comment which has led some historians, notably Edward Gibbon, to take Commodus' reign as the beginning of the decline of the Roman Empire.

In 212, during the reign of Caracalla, Roman citizenship was <EVENT eid="e1015">granted</EVENT> to all freeborn inhabitants of the Empire. But despite this gesture of universality, the Severan dynasty was tumultuous - an emperor's reign was ended routinely by his murder or execution - and following its collapse, the Roman Empire was engulfed by the Crisis of the Third Century, a period of invasions, civil strife, economic depression, and plague. In defining historical epochs, this crisis is sometimes viewed as marking the transition from Classical Antiquity to Late Antiquity. The emaciated illusion of the old Republic was sacrificed for the sake of imposing order: Diocletian (reigned 284 - 305) brought the Empire back from the brink, but declined the role of princeps and became the first emperor to be addressed regularly as domine, "master" or "lord". Diocletian's reign also brought the Empire's most concerted effort against the perceived threat of Christianity, the "Great Persecution".The state of autocratic absolutism that began with Diocletian as the Dominate endured until the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476.

The unity of the Roman Empire was from this point a fiction, as graphically revealed by Diocletian's division of authority among four "co-emperors", the Tetrarchy. Order was shaken again soon after, but was restored by Constantine, who became the first emperor to convert to Christianity, and who established Constantinople as the new capital of the eastern empire. During the decades of the Constantinian and Valentinian dynasties, the Empire was divided along an east-west axis, with dual power centres in Constantinople and Rome. The reign of Julian, who attempted to restore Classical Roman and Hellenistic religion, only briefly interrupted the succession of Christian emperors. Theodosius I, the last emperor to rule over both East and West, died in 395 AD after making Christianity the official state religion.

The Roman Empire <EVENT eid="e1016">began</EVENT> to disintegrate in the late 4th and early 5th century as invasions overwhelmed the capacity of the Empire to govern and mount a coordinated defence. Most chronologies place the end of the Western Roman empire in 476, when Romulus Augustulus was forced to abdicate to the Germanic warlord Odoacer. The empire in the East - known today as the Byzantine Empire, but referred to in its time as the "Roman Empire" or by various other names - <EVENT eid="e1017">ended</EVENT> in 1453 with the death of Constantine XI and the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks.
