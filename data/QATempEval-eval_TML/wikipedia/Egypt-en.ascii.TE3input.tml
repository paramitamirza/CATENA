Egypt, officially: the Arab Republic of Egypt, is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia, via a land bridge formed by the Sinai Peninsula. With over 86 million inhabitants, Egypt is the largest country in the Middle East and the Arab world and the third-largest African country.

Prehistory and Ancient Egypt.

In the 10th millennium BC, a culture of hunter-gatherers and fishers was replaced by a grain-grinding culture. Climate changes or overgrazing around <TIMEX3 tid="t1001">8000 BC</TIMEX3> began to <EVENT eid="e1001">desiccate</EVENT> the pastoral lands of Egypt, <EVENT eid="e1002">forming</EVENT> the Sahara.

By about <TIMEX3 tid="t1002">6000 BC</TIMEX3>, a Neolithic culture rooted in the Nile Valley. The earliest known evidence of Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions <EVENT eid="e1003">appeared</EVENT> during the predynastic period on Naqada III pottery vessels, dated to about 3200 BC. A unified kingdom was <EVENT eid="e1004">founded</EVENT> c. 3150 BC by King Menes, leading to a series of dynasties that ruled Egypt for the next three millennia. Stronger Nile floods and stabilisation of government, however, brought back renewed <EVENT eid="e1005">prosperity</EVENT> for the country in the Middle Kingdom c. 2040 BC, reaching a peak during the reign of Pharaoh Amenemhat III. The New Kingdom c. 1550 - 1070 BC began with the Eighteenth Dynasty, marking the rise of Egypt as an international power that expanded during its greatest extension to an empire as far south as Tombos in Nubia, and included parts of the Levant in the east. This period is noted for some of the most well known Pharaohs, including Hatshepsut, Thutmose III, Akhenaten and his wife Nefertiti, Tutankhamun and Ramesses II. The Thirtieth Dynasty was the last native ruling dynasty during the Pharaonic epoch. It <EVENT eid="e1006">fell</EVENT> to the Persians in 343 BC after the last native Pharaoh, King Nectanebo II, was <EVENT eid="e1007">defeated</EVENT> in battle.

Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt.

The last ruler from the Ptolemaic line was Cleopatra VII, who <EVENT eid="e1008">committed</EVENT> suicide following the burial of her lover Mark Antony who had died in her arms (from a self-inflicted stab wound), after Octavian had <EVENT eid="e1009">captured</EVENT> Alexandria and her mercenary forces had fled. The Ptolemies faced rebellions of native Egyptians often caused by an unwanted regime and were involved in foreign and civil wars that led to the decline of the kingdom and its annexation by Rome. Nevertheless Hellenistic culture continued to thrive in Egypt well after the Muslim conquest.

Christianity was <EVENT eid="e1010">brought</EVENT> to Egypt by Saint Mark the Evangelist in the <TIMEX3 tid="t1003">1st century</TIMEX3>. The New Testament had by then been translated into Egyptian. After the Council of Chalcedon in AD 451, a distinct Egyptian Coptic Church was firmly established.

Middle Ages.

The Byzantines were able to regain control of the country after a brief Persian <EVENT eid="e1011">invasion</EVENT> early in the 7th century, until 639 - 42, when Egypt was invaded and <EVENT eid="e1012">conquered</EVENT> by the Islamic Empire by the Muslim Arabs. By the late 13th century, Egypt linked the Red Sea, India, Malaya, and East Indies. The mid-14th-century Black Death killed about 40% of the country's population.

Egypt Eyalet.

Egypt was <EVENT eid="e1013">conquered</EVENT> by the Ottoman Turks in 1517, after which it <EVENT eid="e1014">became</EVENT> a province of the Ottoman Empire. Isma'il and Tewfik Pasha governed Egypt as a quasi-independent state under Ottoman suzerainty until the British <EVENT eid="e1015">occupation</EVENT> of 1882. Nevertheless, the Khedivate of Egypt (1867 - 1914) remained a de jure Ottoman province until 5 November 1914, when it was declared a British protectorate in reaction to the decision of the Young Turks of the Ottoman Empire to join the First World War on the side of the Central Powers.

Muhammad Ali dynasty.

After the French were defeated by the British, a power vacuum was created in Egypt, and a three-way power struggle ensued between the Ottoman Turks, Egyptian Mamluks who had ruled Egypt for centuries, and Albanian mercenaries in the service of the Ottomans. It ended in victory for the Albanians led by Muhammad Ali. Muhammad Ali <EVENT eid="e1016">established</EVENT> a dynasty that was to rule Egypt until the revolution of <TIMEX3 tid="t1004">1952</TIMEX3>. In later years, the dynasty became a British puppet.

Republic.

Following the 1952 <EVENT eid="e1017">Revolution</EVENT> by the Free Officers Movement, the rule of Egypt <EVENT eid="e1018">passed</EVENT> to military hands. On 18 June 1953, the Egyptian Republic was declared, with General Muhammad Naguib as the first President of the Republic. Naguib was forced to resign in 1954 by Gamal Abdel Nasser  -  the real architect of the 1952 movement  -  and was later <EVENT eid="e1019">put</EVENT> under house arrest. Nasser assumed power as President in June 1956. British forces completed their withdrawal from the occupied Suez Canal Zone on 13 June 1956. He nationalised the Suez Canal on 26 July 1956, prompting the 1956 Suez Crisis.

Sadat made a historic visit to Israel in 1977, which led to the 1979 peace treaty in exchange for Israeli withdrawal from Sinai. Sadat's initiative sparked enormous controversy in the Arab world and led to Egypt's expulsion from the Arab League, but it was supported by most Egyptians. However, Sadat was assassinated by an Islamic extremist. Hosni Mubarak came to power after the assassination of Sadat in a referendum in which he was the only candidate.

Hosni Mubarak reaffirmed Egypt's relationship with Israel yet eased the tensions with Egypt's Arab neighbours as well. Domestically, Mubarak faced many serious problems. Even though farm and industry output expanded, the economy could not keep pace with the population boom. Mass poverty and unemployment led rural families to stream into cities like Cairo where they ended up in crowded slums, barely managing to survive.

In the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, terrorist attacks in Egypt became numerous and severe, and began to target Christian Copts and foreign tourists as well as government officials. In the 1990s an Islamist group, Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, engaged in an extended campaign of violence, from the murders and attempted murders of prominent writers and intellectuals, to the repeated targeting of tourists and foreigners. Serious damage was done to the largest sector of Egypt's economy - tourism - and in turn to the government, but it also devastated the livelihoods of many of the people on whom the group depended for support.

During Mubarak's reign, the political scene was dominated by the National Democratic Party, which was created by Sadat in 1978. It passed 1993 Syndicates Law, 1995 Press Law, and 1999 Nongovernmental Associations Law which hampered freedoms of association and expression by imposing new regulations and draconian penalties on violations. As a result, by the late 1990s parliamentary politics had become virtually irrelevant and alternative avenues for political expression were curtailed as well.

On 17 November 1997, 62 people, mostly tourists, were <EVENT eid="e1020">massacred</EVENT> near Luxor. In late February 2005, Mubarak <EVENT eid="e1021">announced</EVENT> a reform of the presidential election law, paving the way for multi-candidate polls for the first time since the 1952 movement. However, the new law placed restrictions on the candidates, and led to Mubarak's easy re-election victory. Voter turnout was less than 25%. Election observers also alleged government interference in the election process. After the election, Mubarak <EVENT eid="e1022">imprisoned</EVENT> Ayman Nour, the runner-up.

Human Rights Watch's 2006 report on Egypt detailed serious human rights violations, including routine torture, arbitrary detentions and trials before military and state security courts. In 2007, Amnesty International released a report alleging that Egypt had become an international center for torture, where other nations send suspects for interrogation, often as part of the War on Terror. Egypt's foreign ministry quickly issued a rebuttal to this report.

Constitutional changes voted on 19 March 2007 prohibited parties from using religion as a basis for political activity, allowed the drafting of a new anti-terrorism law, authorised broad police powers of arrest and surveillance, and gave the president power to dissolve parliament and end judicial election monitoring. In 2009, Dr. Ali El Deen Hilal Dessouki, Media Secretary of the National Democratic Party (NDP), described Egypt as a "pharaonic" political system, and democracy as a "long term goal". Dessouki also stated that "the real center of power in Egypt is the military".

Revolution.

On 25 January 2011, widespread protests began against Mubarak's government. On 11 February 2011, Mubarak resigned and fled Cairo. Jubilant celebrations broke out in Cairo's Tahrir Square at the news. The Egyptian military then assumed the power to govern. Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, chairman of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, became the de facto interim head of state. On 13 February 2011, the military dissolved the parliament and suspended the constitution.

A constitutional referendum was held on 19 March 2011. On 28 November 2011, Egypt held its first parliamentary election since the previous regime had been in power. Turnout was high and there were no reports of major irregularities or violence. Mohamed Morsi was elected president on 24 June 2012. On 2 August 2012, Egypt's Prime Minister Hisham Qandil announced his 35 member cabinet comprising 28 newcomers including four from the Muslim Brotherhood.

Liberal and secular groups walked out of the constituent assembly because they believed that it would impose strict Islamic practices, while Muslim Brotherhood backers threw their support behind Morsi. On 22 November 2012, President Morsi issued a declaration immunising his decrees from challenge and seeking to protect the work of the constituent assembly.

The move led to massive protests and violent action throughout Egypt. On 5 December 2012, tens of thousands of supporters and opponents of president Morsi clashed, in what was described as the largest violent <EVENT eid="e1023">battle</EVENT> between Islamists and their foes since the country's revolution. Mohamed Morsi offered a "national dialogue" with opposition leaders but refused to cancel the December 2012 constitutional referendum.

On 30 June 2013, massive protests were <EVENT eid="e1024">organised</EVENT> across Egypt against Morsi's rule, leading to the ousting of Morsi by the military on 3 July 2013, where the military removed Morsi from power in a coup d'etat and installed an interim government.

On 4 July 2013, 68-year old Egyptian judge Adly Mansour was sworn in as acting president over the new government following the removal of Morsi. The military-backed Egyptian authorities cracked down on the Muslim Brotherhood and its supporters, jailing thousands and killing hundreds of street protesters. Many of the Muslim Brotherhood leaders and activists have either been sentenced to death or life imprisonment in a series of mass trials.

On 18 January 2014, the interim government institutionalised a new constitution following a referendum in which 98.1% of voters were supportive. Participation was low with only 38.6% of registered voters participating although this was higher than the 33% who voted in a referendum during Morsi's tenure. On 26 March 2014 Abdel Fattah el-Sisi the head of the Egyptian Armed Forces, who at this time was in control of the country, resigned from the military, announcing he would stand as a candidate in the 2014 presidential election. The poll, held between 26 and 28 May 2014, resulted in a landslide victory for el-Sisi. The Muslim Brotherhood and some liberal and secular activist groups boycotted the vote. Even though the military-backed authorities extended voting to a third day, the 46% turnout was lower than the 52% turnout in the 2012 election.
