It's been a crazy <TIMEX3 tid="t1">week</TIMEX3> here at work, but luckily my weekends keep me sane enough to stay in this game called "Ladder Climb in Hollywood". <TIMEX3 tid="t3">Last weekend</TIMEX3> was packed full of fun things. My Aunt Deirdre from Boston is in town on a photo shoot, and my Uncle Pete and 7-month-old cousin Aidan <EVENT eid="e1">came</EVENT> along to chill for the <TIMEX3 tid="t2">week</TIMEX3>. I'm <EVENT eid="e2">babysitting</EVENT> him on Sunday, so I'm hoping all of my big sister/diaper changing/bottle warming techniques come back. Pete, Aidan, and I <EVENT eid="e4">strolled</EVENT> over to the Santa Monica Pier where Red Bull was holding their annual Flugtag event. A gazillion people were there <EVENT eid="e5">watching</EVENT> these groups of people launch their weirdly engineered contraptions off the Pier in hopes that it'll fly. Most designs were top-heavy and immediately <EVENT eid="e6">nosedived</EVENT> into the Pacific. Still fun to watch though. I also <EVENT eid="e7">went</EVENT> with some friends to "The Animation Show" at the Regent Theatre in Hollywood. So much of animation seems filmic these days! It showcased a lot of Mike Judge and Don Hertzfeldt's older work. Don's "Rejected" is still my fave. Very funny. It's coming to a theatre near you. I've been getting some good use out of my longboard lately. It is by far the best leg and ab workout I've had in a long time. AND it has helped my balance and posture tremendously.
