Oh for the love of God, please end this day, this work <TIMEX3 tid="t1">week</TIMEX3>... It's bad enough when I find a transaction on my bank statement that I didn't make, but it's worse when I <EVENT eid="e1">report</EVENT> it to the bank that they fail to tell me they'll be cancelling my card. So depositing two checks , and getting money for the weekend didn't happen this <TIMEX3 tid="t2">morning</TIMEX3>. Apparently someone <EVENT eid="e2">pumped</EVENT> $35 worth of gas at some gas station in North Hollywood on a <TIMEX3 tid="t3">Monday</TIMEX3> during the workday. My car can only hold $20 worth of gas when the gas prices are sky high, I was at <EVENT eid="e5">work</EVENT> that Monday, and I don't ever go to North Hollywood. It's creepy, as I have no idea how someone could've gotten my info. Hopefully it was just a computer glitch on WaMu's part. Mom's latest tip on keeping your credit/debit card number safe : When signing your receipts at a restaurant, be sure to take your copy, but also scratch out your credit card number on the restaurant's copy before leaving it on the table. Your card has already been run through the computer, and there's no use for it after that. Thanks Mom! I'm <EVENT eid="e3">headed</EVENT> to the premiere of the Coen Brothers' "Intolerable Cruelty" <TIMEX3 tid="t4">tomorrow night</TIMEX3>. It's also a wrap party for their latest film remake which finished today, "The Ladykillers," starring Tom Hanks. My friend Jenny (another IU alum) who works on all the Brothers Coen films <EVENT eid="e4">invited</EVENT> me, so it should be a rip roarin' good time. The dress is Hollywood casual, and I still have no clue what that means. I've lived out here for over a year now, and I think I can still count the number of clothes I've purchased on two hands... maybe even one. I'd really love to see Hanks and Clooney in the flesh, and maybe casually elbow Catherine Zeta in the boob. That, or I could show her my stylin' T-Mobile phone. Never really been that big a fan of hers. Hopefully this will be a good networking <TIMEX3 tid="t5">night</TIMEX3> for me, as I'm out of work around Halloween time. :( Treasure your steady jobs, kids.
