I <EVENT eid="e12">told</EVENT> Alison this story earlier in the week and she asked me to <EVENT eid="e13">put</EVENT> it up on the site. It is about a weirdo of a little boy that was coming to the education program at my work. His name, which could be the best part here, is Gockberk. He is from Turkey. And, mind you, he is not a cute Gockberk. The kid has a freakishly huge head and he NEVER stops crying. One day, I was <EVENT eid="e1">roped</EVENT> into holding him after he had been <EVENT eid="e2">crying</EVENT> for maybe 30 minutes. I noticed that the poor Gock was <EVENT eid="e3">dressed</EVENT> in a onesie (the baby underwear that snaps down below), corduroy pants, a heavy dress shirt, and a woolen vest in an 85 degree room. He was all <EVENT eid="e4">sweaty</EVENT> and uncomfortable looking, so I <EVENT eid="e5">took off</EVENT> his vest. He <EVENT eid="e6">stopped</EVENT> crying almost immediately. Just when I was beginning to have some fondness for his large Turkish cranium, his mom <EVENT eid="e7">came</EVENT> in the room and basically <EVENT eid="e8">bitched</EVENT> me out in Turkish for removing the precious vest. Well! Poor Gocky had to <EVENT eid="e9">wear</EVENT> the thing for the rest of the day and pretty much <EVENT eid="e10">cried</EVENT> for the remainder of the day. None of the kids like him because he never shuts up and he is the only Turkish one in the group. After that, he only <EVENT eid="e11">came</EVENT> back once and I think his mom requested that I not be allowed to watch him. I just like his name. Also, there is this crazy show on the WB called urlLink The BeastMaster . Matt and I were watching it this weekend when there was nothing else on tv. It made us laugh but it was really some Tarzan-esque type of show. Check out the site -- this guy is a real hottie!
