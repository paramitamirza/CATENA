SERGIYEV POSAD, Russia - The pilgrims tramped toward the storied monastery by the thousands - chanting prayers, singing and embracing the kind of nationalist fervor that President Vladimir V. Putin seeks to harness as his own.

The official reason for the <EVENT eid="e1">trek</EVENT> to the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius, the seat of the Russian Orthodox faith and the country's original monastery, was to commemorate the <EVENT eid="e2">700th birthday</EVENT> of its founder and namesake.

But amid that tide of pilgrims - official estimates hovered around 30,000 - swirled diverse political and religious currents related to Mr. Putin's effort to cast himself as the defender of traditional values, a <EVENT eid="e3">campaign</EVENT> that has become more pronounced since Russia's involvement with Ukraine.

The birthday celebrations in Sergiyev Posad emphasized St. Sergius's role in shaping a unified Russia, a narrative that dovetails with the nationalism and conservative morals that Mr. Putin espouses.

Some historians and church figures are crying foul, however, over what they say are the Kremlin's efforts to reshape the saint's legacy to enhance political goals, fostering what one critic called "an official cult."

"They are creating a myth around St. Sergius, making him out to be an obedient servant of the Russian state, which he was not," said Irina Karatsuba, a historian who often aligns herself with unpopular causes. "He is one of the important embodiments of what was and is the best in Russia. But the way they are trying to link him to the Russian state is nonsense; it's political manipulation."

The pilgrimage illustrates one way Mr. Putin is trying to use Russian Orthodoxy as a tie that binds Russians together, analysts said, fashioning a fresh ideology for his continued rule after 14 years as either president or prime minister. His <EVENT eid="e4">participation</EVENT> in the St. Sergius celebration last month was broadcast live nationally.

Church officials said they wanted St. Sergius to serve as an example of spiritual hope for Russians in their daily lives.

The Russian Orthodox Church was <EVENT eid="e5">resurrected</EVENT> after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, ending 70 years of often brutal Communist <EVENT eid="e6">repression</EVENT>. The church seems only too happy to hitch its halting rebirth to Mr. Putin's fortunes, hoping to attract more adherents. Although 80 percent of the 140 million Russians identify themselves as Russian Orthodox culturally, the number who actually attend church is tiny. The church says it is nearly 10 percent, but experts say it has long hovered around 3 percent.

Another reason for St. Sergius's elevation is the current crisis in Ukraine.

The <EVENT eid="e7">birth</EVENT> of the Russian Orthodox faith dates back to Vladimir the Great, grand prince of Kiev, and the mass baptisms performed at his behest there in 988, bringing Christianity to what then became Holy Rus.

But now that Russia and Ukraine are locked in a proxy war, the government and the church realize that the physical link to an important religious symbol is being severed, noted Geraldine Fagan, author of "Believing in Russia - Religious Policy After Communism."

Because those roots - not to mention the relics of St. Vladimir himself - are in the territory of an estranged neighbor, Russia appears to be casting St. Sergius as his replacement, Ms. Fagan said.

In the <TIMEX3 tid="t1">late 14th century</TIMEX3>, aside from founding the first monastery, St. Sergius of Radonezh <EVENT eid="e8">persuaded</EVENT> the Russian princes to stop their murderous, internecine fighting and concentrate on throwing off the Mongol yoke.

"St. Sergius was the beginning not just of Russian monasticism or the Russian spiritual tradition," said Vladimir Legoyda, the head of the information department for the Holy Synod. "In many ways he is the source of Russia itself."

The saint has long been revered as a humble figure, content to spend his days in prayer and dressing like a beggar. He turned down the job of leading the church, but was given the unique title of abbot for all Russia.

"He is a great personality in Russian history," said Margarita Popova, a 48-year-old English teacher who traveled 17 hours by bus with her teenage son from their home near Volgograd for the anniversary. "Russia before Sergei Radonezh and Russia after was perhaps two different Russias."

Ordinary people, Ms. Popova said, do not have the time to pray for themselves, for Russia and for the world constantly. The monks who do so are following a tradition started in the Russian Orthodox Church by St. Sergius. He is often identified as the original staretz, a Russian word that means a monastic spiritual leader, one who has achieved tangible experience in the future kingdom of God.

Beyond spiritual matters, the crowd at the birthday commemoration at the monastery here, 45 miles north of Moscow, was unquestionably in the Putin camp. Many compared him to a czar, and meant it as a compliment.

"He has just not been anointed," said Vladimir Bubelev, 60, an officer in the naval reserves wearing a brass pin showing the profile of Nicholas II, the last czar, on his lapel.

"But his powers are greater than those of Nicholas II," Mr. Bubelev said. "On many questions he acts like a monarch - he makes correct, willful decisions. This is very good. Plus he is a believer!"

As it happens, the birthday of St. Sergius and the anniversary of the death of Nicholas II fall within a couple of days of each other in July. The church made Nicholas II and his immediate family saints in 2000. The czar's 1917 <EVENT eid="e9">overthrow</EVENT> was for many Orthodox faithful the last time that a man anointed by God governed Russia.

When the czars ruled, Mr. Bubelev persisted, Russia evoked both nobility and morality. The Romanovs deeply revered both St. Sergius and a later, 19th-century monk, St. Seraphim of Sarov, also worshiped by the Russian Orthodox.

"They helped the czars rule Russia in the right way - they made Russia rich," Mr. Bubelev said. The czars "went to their relics and asked for God's help, and they succeeded. Thank God Mr. Putin is asking for their help now."

But Ms. Karatsuba, the historian, pointed out that the Romanov rulers also <EVENT eid="e10">tried</EVENT> to elevate the concept of Holy Rus as a national ideal in their campaign to stall political reform in the 19th century. That turned out badly for them in 1917, she noted.

Still, the Slavic nationalism prevalent among the faithful makes them a natural base of support for Mr. Putin's policy that all ethnic Russians are worthy of protection wherever they are. That has been his stated reason for championing the cause of anti-Kiev insurgents in southeastern Ukraine.

"We are all one people, we are all part of Holy Rus," said Dmitry Markov, 28, a buyer for a cellphone company who attended the St. Sergius commemoration. "Any person, regardless of where he lives, if he is Russian in spirit, he must be defended by his president, by his country, because he is an indivisible part of the nation."

Mr. Putin, who <EVENT eid="e11">attended</EVENT> the anniversary celebration less than 24 hours after a civilian plane <EVENT eid="e12">disaster</EVENT> in Ukraine that many blamed on Moscow, addressed the faithful for only about five minutes. He lauded the "patriotic, national and moral resurgence" inspired by the monk, including his campaign to build monasteries as both spiritual centers and real fortresses to protect Russia.

"His wise and solid words as a mentor and guide were a spiritual pillar and support during a difficult time of foreign invasion and internal discord," Mr. Putin said.

"It was then that he spoke his prophetic words: 'Our salvation lies in love and unity,' " Mr. Putin said. "This appeal, filled with unshakable faith, helped to unite Russia's lands and stamped itself forever on our people's soul and in our historical memory."

The commemoration, planned for years, provoked some quiet grumbling within the church itself, however, that it was too elaborate. With a <EVENT eid="e13">war</EVENT> raging next door, the money could have been spent on better things, critics said.

Patriarch Kirill I himself led the 10-mile procession that started the commemoration, beginning from the monastery at Khotkovo, where the saint's parents are buried, to the St. Sergius monastery. The patriarch walked under a white umbrella carried by a younger priest, and during a break in the march closeted himself away from the adoring throng in an air-conditioned mobile home.

"Faith without deeds is dead," said Michael Storojinsky, 53, a religious music producer, explaining why he was walking for five hours under the relentless summer sun. "I was a Communist in the days when the Communist Party said it was battling religious superstition," he said. The party "placed itself on the pedestal that was meant to be occupied by God."
