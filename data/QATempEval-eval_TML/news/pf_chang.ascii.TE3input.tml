P.F. Chang's China Bistro Inc. has provided new details about a security breach <EVENT eid="e1">discovered</EVENT> in <TIMEX3 tid="t1">June</TIMEX3>, saying customer data may have been <EVENT eid="e2">stolen</EVENT> from 33 restaurants in 16 states, including eight in California. 

The restaurant chain <EVENT eid="e3">said</EVENT> Monday that credit card numbers, expiration dates and, in some cases, cardholder names were stolen over <TIMEX3 tid="t2">eight months</TIMEX3>.

The company said the <EVENT eid="e6">breach</EVENT> occurred between Oct. 19, 2013, and June 11, 2014. 

The intrusion was first reported by security blogger Brian Krebs, who said on his website that banks reported data from thousands of customers had been pilfered from locations in Florida, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Nevada and North Carolina, and was being sold online. 

Federico said P.F. Chang's conducted an internal investigation with the help of forensic data experts, and <EVENT eid="e7">determined</EVENT> the 33 locations affected and specific time frames the credit card processing system was compromised for each.

He also said the company has been <EVENT eid="e8">processing</EVENT> card data securely since <TIMEX3 tid="t3">June 11</TIMEX3>.
