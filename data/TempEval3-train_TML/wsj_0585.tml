OTC Focus: @ Sell Programs @ Are Hurting @ Market Makers @ ---- @ By Sonja Steptoe and Craig Smith @ Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal 10/30/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) STOCK INDEXES (NDX) SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) NEW YORK

<TEXT>
Market makers in Nasdaq over-the-counter stocks are <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">adding</EVENT> their voices to the swelling chorus of complaints about program trading.

Their motivation, however, has a strong practical aspect: Program trading is hazardous to their paychecks. The most controversial form of program trading, stock-index arbitrage, is " <EVENT eid="e298" class="OCCURRENCE">making</EVENT> it tough for traders to make money," <EVENT eid="e297" class="REPORTING">declares</EVENT> Robert Antolini, head of OTC trading at Donaldson, Lufkin amp Jenrette.

Stock-index <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE">arbitrage</EVENT> -- the computer-guided buying and selling of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to profit from fleeting price discrepancies -- <EVENT eid="e25" class="I_STATE">affects</EVENT> the OTC market directly through the 31 stocks included in Standard amp Poor's 500-stock index. The SampP 500 is often used in arbitrage strategies.

The portion of OTC volume attributable to program trading isn't known, as it is on the New York Stock Exchange, where it <EVENT eid="e34" class="OCCURRENCE">amounted</EVENT> to more than 13% in <TIMEX3 tid="t295" type="DATE" value="1989-09" temporalFunction="true" functionInDocument="NONE" anchorTimeID="t0">September</TIMEX3>. <EVENT eid="e35" class="I_STATE">Estimates</EVENT> from traders put it at less than 5% of Nasdaq's average daily volume of roughly 133 million shares.

Other market-maker gripes: Program <EVENT eid="e38" class="OCCURRENCE">trading</EVENT> also <EVENT eid="e39" class="OCCURRENCE">causes</EVENT> the Nasdaq Composite Index to <EVENT eid="e41" class="OCCURRENCE">lose</EVENT> ground against other segments of the stock market. Because of program <EVENT eid="e43" class="OCCURRENCE">trading</EVENT> it is more <EVENT eid="e299" class="I_STATE">difficult</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e45" class="OCCURRENCE">trade</EVENT> many OTC stocks without sharp price <EVENT eid="e46" class="OCCURRENCE">moves</EVENT>, a condition known as illiquidity. Moreover, the price <EVENT eid="e302" class="STATE">volatility</EVENT> that is <EVENT eid="e48" class="OCCURRENCE">amplified</EVENT> by program <EVENT eid="e49" class="OCCURRENCE">trading</EVENT> is <EVENT eid="e50" class="I_ACTION">undercutting</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e51" class="I_ACTION">efforts</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e53" class="OCCURRENCE">woo</EVENT> individual investors back to an OTC market that sorely <EVENT eid="e55" class="OCCURRENCE">misses</EVENT> them.

Some of these <EVENT eid="e547" class="STATE">problems</EVENT> are neither new nor unique to the OTC market. But the big, often tumultuous <EVENT eid="e57" class="OCCURRENCE">slide</EVENT> in stock prices <TIMEX3 tid="t303" type="DATE" value="1989-10" temporalFunction="true" functionInDocument="NONE" anchorTimeID="t0">this month</TIMEX3> has <EVENT eid="e58" class="I_STATE">turned</EVENT> some of those who have been <EVENT eid="e59" class="OCCURRENCE">profiting</EVENT> from the practice against it.

Peter DaPuzzo, head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton, <EVENT eid="e63" class="REPORTING">acknowledges</EVENT> that he wasn't <EVENT eid="e305" class="STATE">troubled</EVENT> by program <EVENT eid="e64" class="OCCURRENCE">trading</EVENT> when it <EVENT eid="e66" class="ASPECTUAL">began</EVENT> in the pre-crash bull market because it <EVENT eid="e69" class="OCCURRENCE">added</EVENT> liquidity and people were <EVENT eid="e308" class="I_STATE">pleased</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e71" class="PERCEPTION">see</EVENT> stock prices <EVENT eid="e72" class="OCCURRENCE">rising</EVENT>.

"We weren't as concerned until they <EVENT eid="e75" class="OCCURRENCE">became</EVENT> sell programs," <EVENT eid="e76" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT> Mr. DaPuzzo, who <TIMEX3 tid="t311" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF" temporalFunction="true" functionInDocument="NONE" anchorTimeID="t0">now</TIMEX3> <EVENT eid="e77" class="I_STATE">thinks</EVENT> it <EVENT eid="e78" class="OCCURRENCE">adds</EVENT> unnecessary volatility. Shearson Lehman, however, executes program trades for clients.

Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Kidder Peabody, in addition to Shearson, do program-trade OTC stocks. Shearson, Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs say they do so only for customers, however. Kidder Peabody does program trading for its own as well as clients' accounts.

Of course, there were sell <EVENT eid="e318" class="STATE">programs</EVENT> in <TIMEX3 tid="t320" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF" temporalFunction="true" functionInDocument="NONE" anchorTimeID="t0">past years</TIMEX3>, too, but they <EVENT eid="e90" class="I_STATE">seem</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e92" class="OCCURRENCE">hurt</EVENT> market makers more painfully <TIMEX3 tid="t321" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF" temporalFunction="true" functionInDocument="NONE" anchorTimeID="t0">these days</TIMEX3>. That's largely because of defensive measures they <EVENT eid="e94" class="OCCURRENCE">adopted</EVENT> after the <TIMEX3 tid="t323" type="DATE" value="1987" temporalFunction="false" functionInDocument="NONE">1987</TIMEX3> <EVENT eid="e95" class="OCCURRENCE">crash</EVENT>, when individual investors <EVENT eid="e98" class="OCCURRENCE">fled</EVENT> the market and trading activity <EVENT eid="e101" class="OCCURRENCE">dwindled</EVENT>. Market makers, to <EVENT eid="e103" class="OCCURRENCE">cut</EVENT> costs, <EVENT eid="e104" class="OCCURRENCE">slashed</EVENT> inventories of stocks they keep on hand to sell investors when other holders aren't selling.

And to <EVENT eid="e114" class="I_ACTION">protect</EVENT> their reduced capital investment from <EVENT eid="e117" class="OCCURRENCE">eroding</EVENT> further, market makers became quicker to <EVENT eid="e324" class="OCCURRENCE">lower</EVENT> price quotes when sell programs are <EVENT eid="e1093" class="STATE">in</EVENT> progress. On days when prices are tumbling, they must be <EVENT eid="e326" class="I_STATE">willing</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e127" class="OCCURRENCE">buy</EVENT> shares from sellers when no one else will. In such an environment, market makers can <EVENT eid="e130" class="OCCURRENCE">suffer</EVENT> huge <EVENT eid="e327" class="OCCURRENCE">losses</EVENT> both on trades made that day at steadily dropping prices and in the value of their inventories of shares.

"It <EVENT eid="e329" class="I_STATE">makes</EVENT> no <EVENT eid="e140" class="I_STATE">sense</EVENT> for us to <EVENT eid="e142" class="OCCURRENCE">put</EVENT> money at risk when you <EVENT eid="e147" class="I_STATE">know</EVENT> you're going to lose," <EVENT eid="e151" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT> Mr. Antolini, of Donaldson Lufkin.

But this <EVENT eid="e330" class="STATE">skittishness</EVENT>, Mr. Antolini says, is <EVENT eid="e153" class="OCCURRENCE">creating</EVENT> liquidity <EVENT eid="e331" class="STATE">problems</EVENT> in certain OTC stocks. "It's harder to sell stocks when the sell programs come in because some market makers don't want to { take the orders}. No one has big positions and no one wants to take big risks."

Joseph Hardiman, president of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which oversees trading on Nasdaq, <EVENT eid="e171" class="I_ACTION">agrees</EVENT> that program trading is <EVENT eid="e173" class="OCCURRENCE">hurting</EVENT> the market's <EVENT eid="e175" class="I_ACTION">efforts</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e177" class="OCCURRENCE">bring</EVENT> back small investors. But, he <EVENT eid="e178" class="REPORTING">observes</EVENT>, while makers <EVENT eid="e180" class="I_STATE">suffer</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e333" class="OCCURRENCE">losses</EVENT> when program trading <EVENT eid="e184" class="OCCURRENCE">drags</EVENT> the market down, they also <EVENT eid="e185" class="OCCURRENCE">make</EVENT> money when program trading <EVENT eid="e190" class="OCCURRENCE">pushes</EVENT> the prices higher. "Sometimes {traders} <EVENT eid="e191" class="OCCURRENCE">lose</EVENT> sight of that," he <EVENT eid="e193" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT>.

The OTC stocks in the SampP 500 include Nasdaq's biggest, such as Apple Computer, MCI Communications, Tele-Communications and Liz Claiborne. These big stocks greatly influence the Nasdaq Composite Index. When the computers say "sell," the composite tumbles as well as the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

The problem, market makers say, is that while the industrial average and the SampP 500 usually recover as buy programs kick in, the Nasdaq Composite frequently is left behind.

<TIMEX3 tid="t336" type="DURATION" value="P8D" mod="EQUAL_OR_MORE" temporalFunction="false" functionInDocument="NONE" beginPoint="t335">Eight trading days</TIMEX3> after <TIMEX3 tid="t335" type="DATE" value="1989-10-12" temporalFunction="true" functionInDocument="NONE" anchorTimeID="t0">Oct. 12</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t338" type="DATE" value="1989-10-12" temporalFunction="true" functionInDocument="NONE" anchorTimeID="t335">the day</TIMEX3> before the stock market <EVENT eid="e205" class="OCCURRENCE">plunge</EVENT>, for instance, the Nasdaq Composite had <EVENT eid="e208" class="OCCURRENCE">fallen</EVENT> 4.3%, compared with 3.3% for the SampP 500, 3.5% for the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index and 3.6% for the industrial average. This gap eventually <EVENT eid="e210" class="OCCURRENCE">closes</EVENT>, but slowly. <TIMEX3 tid="t341" type="DURATION" value="P3D" temporalFunction="false" functionInDocument="NONE" endPoint="t340">Three days</TIMEX3> later, as of <TIMEX3 tid="t340" type="DATE" value="1989-10-27" temporalFunction="true" functionInDocument="NONE" anchorTimeID="t0">Friday</TIMEX3>'s <EVENT eid="e211" class="OCCURRENCE">close</EVENT>, the Nasdaq Composite was down 6%, compared with 5.9% for the industrial average, 5.7% for the SampP 500 and 5.8% for the Big Board Composite.

The main reason for this <EVENT eid="e214" class="OCCURRENCE">lag</EVENT> is that individual investors <EVENT eid="e345" class="STATE">own</EVENT> 65% of the OTC market's capitalization, <EVENT eid="e346" class="REPORTING">according</EVENT> to Mr. Hardiman, much more than on the Big Board. Such investors tend to be more cautious than institutional investors are about re-entering the market after massive selloffs, market makers say.

The Nasdaq Composite Index <EVENT eid="e223" class="OCCURRENCE">tumbled</EVENT> 5.39, or 1.2% to 452.76 on <TIMEX3 tid="t356" type="DATE" value="1989-10-27" temporalFunction="true" functionInDocument="NONE" anchorTimeID="t0">Friday</TIMEX3>.
