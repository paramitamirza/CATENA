The Iraqi ambassador to Greece <EVENT eid="e124" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> in Athens the Americans and other stranded foreigners could <EVENT eid="e126" class="OCCURRENCE">leave</EVENT> ``as soon as the threats from the United States and its allies are <EVENT eid="e128" class="OCCURRENCE">eliminated</EVENT>.''

A steep <EVENT eid="e173" class="OCCURRENCE">rise</EVENT> in world oil prices followed the Kuwait <EVENT eid="e175" class="OCCURRENCE">invasion</EVENT>. The U.N.

Truckloads of goods <EVENT eid="e203" class="OCCURRENCE">rolled</EVENT> into Iraq from Jordan on <TIMEX3 tid="t204" type="DATE" value="1990-08-07" temporalFunction="true" functionInDocument="NONE" anchorTimeID="t0">Tuesday</TIMEX3> and Iraqi-bound cargo was <EVENT eid="e206" class="OCCURRENCE">unloaded</EVENT> from ships at the Red Sea port ofAqaba despite the U.N.-ordered <EVENT eid="e207" class="OCCURRENCE">sanctions</EVENT>. King Hussein was reportedly <EVENT eid="e208" class="OCCURRENCE">carrying</EVENT> a message to Bush from Iraq's Saddam, with whom the king <EVENT eid="e209" class="OCCURRENCE">met</EVENT> <TIMEX3 tid="t210" type="DATE" value="1990-08-06" temporalFunction="true" functionInDocument="NONE">Monday</TIMEX3>.

In an <EVENT eid="e218" class="OCCURRENCE">interview</EVENT> from Jordan on ABC, he <EVENT eid="e219" class="I_ACTION">declined</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e220" class="OCCURRENCE">discuss</EVENT> details, but <EVENT eid="e221" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT>: ``I don't <EVENT eid="e223" class="I_STATE">think</EVENT> that his majesty would be <EVENT eid="e225" class="OCCURRENCE">traveling</EVENT> at <TIMEX3 tid="t1192" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF" temporalFunction="true" functionInDocument="NONE" anchorTimeID="t215">this crucial moment</TIMEX3> if the Iraqi leadership did not have a rational approach to the future.''

A CBS News report <EVENT eid="e230" class="REPORTING">citing</EVENT> unidentified Jordanian sources <EVENT eid="e231" class="REPORTING">said</EVENT> that Saddam's message <EVENT eid="e232" class="OCCURRENCE">called</EVENT> for an international conference to be <EVENT eid="e234" class="OCCURRENCE">convened</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e235" class="OCCURRENCE">discuss</EVENT> an Iraqi <EVENT eid="e236" class="OCCURRENCE">withdrawal</EVENT> from Kuwait. In exchange, the <EVENT eid="e238" class="OCCURRENCE">buildup</EVENT> of U.S. forces in the region would <EVENT eid="e240" class="OCCURRENCE">halt</EVENT>. Bush, however, <EVENT eid="e241" class="REPORTING">says</EVENT> he <EVENT eid="e242" class="PERCEPTION">sees</EVENT> no short-term hope for a diplomatic solution to the gulf <EVENT eid="e244" class="OCCURRENCE">crisis</EVENT> _ at least until economic sanctions <EVENT eid="e245" class="OCCURRENCE">force</EVENT> Saddam to <EVENT eid="e246" class="OCCURRENCE">withdraw</EVENT> his army. Bush <EVENT eid="e247" class="OCCURRENCE">held</EVENT> out the prospect of more aid to Jordan if it <EVENT eid="e249" class="OCCURRENCE">cooperates</EVENT> with the trade embargo. On <TIMEX3 tid="t252" type="DATE" value="1990-08-07" temporalFunction="true" functionInDocument="NONE" anchorTimeID="t0">Tuesday</TIMEX3>, the United States and Soviet Union <EVENT eid="e253" class="OCCURRENCE">conferred</EVENT> in Washington on <EVENT eid="e254" class="OCCURRENCE">putting</EVENT> an anti-Iraq naval <EVENT eid="e255" class="OCCURRENCE">blockade</EVENT> under a United Nations umbrella.

The <EVENT eid="e258" class="OCCURRENCE">embargo</EVENT> is <EVENT eid="e259" class="I_STATE">meant</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e260" class="OCCURRENCE">cripple</EVENT> Iraq by <EVENT eid="e261" class="OCCURRENCE">cutting</EVENT> off its exports of oil and imports of food and military supplies.

Iraq <EVENT eid="e262" class="OCCURRENCE">imports</EVENT> about three-quarters of its foodstuffs.
