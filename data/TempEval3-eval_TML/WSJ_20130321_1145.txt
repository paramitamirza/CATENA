In
competitions
against
the
clock
,
some
athletes
display
an
ability
to
seize
control
.

Think
of
the
Clark-Kent-to-Superman
routines
that
John
Elway
and
Michael
Jordan
often
pulled
in
the
final
seconds
.

But
Iram
Leon
stands
on
the
sidelines
of
his
own
race
against
time
.

Lodged
in
his
brain
is
an
untreatable
and
inoperable
cancerous
tumor
that
statistics
suggest
will
kill
him
before
he
is
40
,
eight
years
from
now
.

Medical
science
is
advancing
at
a
rate
that
does
n't
preclude
the
development
of
a
treatment
,
but
it
's
not
clear
if
it
will
come
in
time
.

"
No
one
knows
what
technology
will
be
available
in
five
years
,
"
said
Allan
Friedman
,
Duke
University
Hospital
neurosurgeon
in
chief
,
who
in
2011
removed
as
much
of
Leon
's
brain
tumor
as
possible
.

The
torment
of
enduring
that
wait
can
paste
a
cancer
patient
to
the
couch
,
a
surrender
heavily
associated
with
deadlier
outcomes
.

Some
seek
escape
in
their
careers
,
but
that
is
no
longer
an
option
for
Leon
,
who
early
this
year
was
forced
to
step
down
as
a
juvenile
probation
officer
in
Travis
County
,
Texas
,
a
position
he
had
held
for
almost
seven
years
.

His
thinking
is
no
longer
clear
,
said
Leon
,
adding
,
"
I
was
making
too
many
mistakes
on
the
stand
.
"

But
Leon
can
still
run
.

Two
years
after
his
brain-cancer
diagnosis
,
he
recently
ran
a
sub-five-minute
mile
for
the
first
time
since
high
school
.

What
has
startled
the
medical
community
even
more
is
what
Leon
did
this
month
in
Beaumont
,
Texas
.

He
won
the
Gusher
Marathon
,
finishing
in
3:07:35
.

That
was
one
second
slower
than
his
personal
record
in
the
26.2-mile
event
,
set
days
before
he
underwent
brain
surgery
in
early
2011
.
